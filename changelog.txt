Changelog

Version 1.2.8 (Jan 20, 2019):
  -(Tattletale) Fixed a bug with sprite data in sa1 not being displaced correctly. This would cause random sprites to spawn when extension byte was used (didn't happen every time). Also added some doc/comments to main.asm while I was at it.

Version 1.2.7 (Jan 13, 2019):
  -(Tattletale) Routines ChangeMap16, ExtendedHurt, SubVertPos, SubHorzPos, SpawnSprite, GetMap16 and GetDrawInfo were updated so their top-most labels were removed and only sublabels are used within them to avoid issues with asar. Reported by DigitalSine.

Version 1.2.6 (Dec 30, 2018):
  -(Tattletale) Fixed an issue with ChangeMap16 in vertical levels.
  -(Tattletale) Fixed an issue with GetMap16 in vertical levels.

Version 1.2.5 (Dec 29, 2018):
  -(Tattletale) Fixed an inconsistency I left in main.asm that would cause a half-state of the perlevel feature to be inserted. Without -npl this would cause the first shooter or generator to not spawn properly.
  -(Tattletale) Perlevel sprite has been turned off by default.
  -(Tattletale) -npl doesn't do anything anymore, but is still around so stuff don't break with it.
  -(Tattletale) New flag -pl created so you can still use sprite perlevel feature.
  -(Tattletale) Bugfix on the LM version detection code. Rude, rude mistake (didn't affect anyone unless you use lm 193 and 16x), unredeemable.
  -(Tattletale) Fixed a bug in error handling for sprite per level below B0 or above BF.
  -(Tattletale) CFG Editor now opens either cfg or json without changing file types in the menu (mask is *.json; *.cfg).
  -(Tattletale) Fixed thwomp json mappings.
  -(Tattletale) Donut Lift's code reverted. Now it should be working normally. I'm sorry I left a piece of test code there.

Version 1.2.4 (Dec 25, 2018):
  -(Tattletale) Recompiled with new g++. Added namespace as a fix for the macro sublabel shenanigan.
  -(Tattletale) Updated Asar dll to 1.61.
  -(Tattletale) SA-1 16bit sprite data pointer support.
  -(Tattletale) FastROM pagination sprite data pointer support.
  -(Tattletale) GetMap16 and ChangeMap16 were replaced by Akaginite's implementation. Added support to new LM.
  -(Tattletale) Sprite 7B is entirely reserved to LM, so nothing inserted in the 7B slot will work as a custom sprite.
  -(Tattletale) SubOffScreen updated to consider new LM settings.
  -(Tattletale) Fixed a bug with SubOffScreen, it would run all checks even when the sprite is on screen.
  -(Tattletale) Aiming routine update to use Akaginite's version.
  -(Tattletale) All routines were updated to use ?+/?- instead of +/- to avoid redefines outside the routine context.

Version 1.2.3 (Jul 15, 2018):
  -(Telinc1) Updated to use Asar 1.60 DLL.
  -(Telinc1) Fixed problems with the Aiming, ExtendedGetDrawInfo and Random routines.

Version 1.2.2 (Jun 10, 2018):
  -(Blind Devil) Fixed Star.asm, which didn't have a bank wrapper, thus not
   reading tables correctly.
  -(Blind Devil) Fixed sa1def.asm, uncommenting the !7FAB64 define macro
   (Extra Byte 4), and also correcting the default SA-1 address of
   !extra_byte_4, used by the tool, which was wrong (default was $4000D8
   when the correct is $4000DB).

Version 1.2.1 (Jan 17, 2018):
  -(RPG Hacker) Added a changelog so that we don't have to search all over the
   internet for things that have changed between versions.
   (Note that information on versions prior to this one may be inaccurate)
  -(RPG Hacker) Added missing command line arguments to Readme.
  -(Blind Devil) Fixed SubOffScren.asm.
  -(LX5) Fixed some extended sprites defines having wrong RAM addresses.

Version 1.2 (Dec 04, 2017):
 (Information on this version added post-released by RPG Hacker, may not be accurate,
 feel free to fix any mistakes and add any missing information)
  -Added support for JSON configuration file (with CFG files still supported for
   backwards-compatibility).
  -Added functionality to generate .ssc, .mwt, .mw2 and .s16 files from information
   embedded into the JSON sprite configuration files.
   (Those files are used by Lunar Magic for displaying sprites more nicelys in the editor)
  -Updated the CFG Editor so that it actually lets you edit said embedded information
   in the JSON files via a more intuitive GUI, inspired by Lunar Magic's interface.
  -Added -npl option to disable per-level sprites. This is primarily intended as a
   workaround for Asar's "freedata align" freezing bug.
   NOTE: Do not use on ROMs with sprites already inserted into slots B0 to BF.
  -Added -a <asm> option to override the asm path PIXI uses.
  -Improved handling for when the ROM isn't in the same folder as PIXI by converting paths
   to either relative to the ROM or relative to the executable.

Version 1.1 (Jul 29, 2017):
 (Information on this version added post-released by RPG Hacker, may not be accurate,
 feel free to fix any mistakes and add any missing information)
  -Added support for cluster sprites.
  -Added support for extended sprite.
  -Added support for up to 4 extra bytes per sprite that can be set via Lunar Magic.
  -Renamed and added new command line options for customizing the paths PIXI uses.
  -Updated CFG Editor, which now contains all the functionality of Tweaker.
  -(RPG Hacker; Aug 22, 2017) Fixed a couple of bugs in different included ASM files,
   mainly in regards to SA-1 compatibility.
